# Among Us Player Tracker

It's a simple tracker to keep track who's innocent and potential impostor in the game Among Us.
Made for hacktiv8 phase-0 final project.

Demo available [here](https://0x67.github.io/phase0-final-project/).


## Features

* Map view. Now you no longer confused of where to go and what to do.
* Draggable player-image based on color and category (innocent, suspicious, etc) to better at predicting who's impostor.



## TODO

* Flexible `div` size. If no players are inside, the size will be 0. And the opposite, if more players are added size will increase.

## Known Bug/Issues

* If player image is dragged to another image, it will override the other image.
